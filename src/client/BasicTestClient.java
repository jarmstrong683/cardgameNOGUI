 * A basic client that tests your model implementation.
 * <p>
 * Tests performed by this client are not exhaustive. As such you are encouraged
 * to write your own test client to test your model.
 * <p>
 * This client was used to produce the supplied output trace. You should compare
 * the output of this class using your model with the output trace. As such it's
 * advisable to write your own test client rather modifying this one.
 * <p>
 * This class also uses the Validator (from lib/validator.jar) to check
 * adherence to the specifications.
